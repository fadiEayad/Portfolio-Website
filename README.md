# Portfolio-Website
I wanted to work around a little bit with web development tools like html, css, javascript, bootstrap, react, and more.
I decided that a good first step would be to build a portfolio website to get a general idea and then hopefully move onto bigger things.
This has been long due and I'm glad that I finally started!
