# Portfolio-Website
I wanted to work around a little bit with web development tools like html, css, javascript, bootstrap, react, and more.
I decided that a good first step would be to build a portfolio website to get a general idea and then hopefully move onto bigger things.
I do have another project in my repositories that utilized these tools, but I worked on it with a group who knew more about bootstrap and react. This time, I want to build something alone so I can learn more about these tools.
This has been long due and I'm glad that I finally started!
